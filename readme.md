Analysis

Overview of Project

The purpose of our project is analyze our kickstarter data to understand how various campaigns tended perform in terms of their launch dates
and funding goals and determine what patterns there might be. 
We visualized the campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals.

Analysis and Challenges

We focused on kickstarter plays. We compared the launch date of the campaigns with their outcomes, whether successful, failed or canceled.
We visualized our data with a line graph. The data showed a clear peak in success in May, failed and canceled campaigns did not show a clear peak 
based on launch date.
We also segmented the data by the goal amount and compared the various goal amounts with outcomes. The results showed a clear trend. The campaigns with
a goal of less than $1,000 had the highest percent of successful outcomes, with just shy of 80 percent successful. 
The next most successful segment was $1,000-$4,999, with just a light decrease in succesful outcomes. The decreasing success trend continued by goal amount 
until $25,000-$29,999. From there it increased again before falling to zero percent succesful with $45,000-$49,999. Few above $50,000 were successful.

Challenges included the necessary attention to detail with consistent spelling and having the formula to produce the data we're looking for. 
For example, writing "cancelled" instead of "canceled" wouldn't return an error, but give a value of zero, since the cells had the value
"canceled", not "cancelled." With similiar forumlas for various colums, it's easy to mix them up or put in a formual that isn't quite what we're
looking for. There's also a large amount of data we're going through, with many columns making it easy to pick a column we didn't intend to while
doing our formulas. Futher, there's the issue that the figures depend on the kickstarter data sheet, if we make unintended changes to the kickstarter
sheet, it will throw off the results.

Results

May was far and away the most ideal time to launch a campaign, with success trailing off after the peak in May. December was the least ideal. 
Although much lower from the peak in May, we see a sharp increase in success in January, after the lowest point in December. The data would seem
to indicate that a campaign ought to be launched in May, and December should be avoided.

In terms of success based on launch date, the lower the goal the more success was had. The trend of lower goals and higher success continues
until $25,000-$29,999 where it increased again until $40,000, where is drops off steeply. If 
we rely on this data, we might recommend keeping goals less than $4,999 or around $35,000-45,000.

In determining the relationships between outcomes, launch dates and goals we are limited to understanding that a relationship seems to exist. 
The data could be seasonal or it could simply be due to events that happened unrelated to seasonality. People could be less likely to give money
in December or the campaign could be less well run in December. It's not clear if there is a causal relationship or if there is, which causes which.
It would be good to have a larger time span of data to see if the trends are seasonal.

It would be interesting to see how other factors might determine the success of a campaign. The timespan between launch date and deadline. 
Is a short amount of time for a campaign better than a longer one? What's the best category or subcategory? What are the trends over years, 
rather than during specific months?
